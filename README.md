# Vaccine-Supply-Chain-Optimization-Using-LPP-and-Machine-Learning

In this project, we aimed at solving 2 parts of a Supply Chain Management- the Economic and Delay Considerations.
In the economic considerations part of the report, vaccine transport logistics were modelled using the Fixed Costs
Capacitated Facility Location formulation. This was solved in Python with the help of the Pyomo Library and
the GNU Linear Programming Kit. In the second part of this project, we have used several Machine Learning
techniques in order to detect delayed deliveries of HIV medicines. This is a combined classification-regression
problem. We have compared models such as Linear SVC, Random Forest,Multi-Layer Perceptron, Extra Trees
ensemble using parameters such as RMSE, F1 score,R - Squared. Sklearn library in Python has been used for this
purpose.
